Blogs have articles _-- oh great wisdom --_ and articles have styles. This article is a comprehensive style reference for the diverse range of formatting in this blog, showcasing the visual representation of each style when rendered.

## We start with the most frequent title

The most frequent title is the **H2**, as it divides each section of the article. We can appreciate it just above.

### A title to departmentalize content

An **H3** is a title used to departmentalize content. That is, to divide a section into subsections.

#### Sub-departmentalizing the departmentalization of content

An **H4** is a title used to sub-departmentalize content. That is, to divide a subsection into sub-subsections. It is also the smallest subdivision used in this blog.

## Images and their descriptions

Images are visual tools that help to better understand the content, and may or may not have a description. Below is an image with and without a description.

## Code

There are times when you need to show code, and for that you use a code block.

```js
const toAdd = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const addNums = (nums) => nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log(addNums(toAdd));
```

## Tables

Tables are a way to show information in an **_ordered_** and **_visual_** way. For example, we can show a table with information about people.

| Name  | Age | Profession         |
| ----- | --- | ------------------ |
| Kevin | 24  | Software Developer |
| John  | 30  | Data Scientist     |
| Mary  | 28  | Graphic Designer   |
| Maria | 28  | Accountant         |

## Shining box

`This is a shining box, it's used to highlight important information. It's a simple way to make the reader focus on a specific part of the content.`

## Blockquote

There are two different styles of blockquotes, one for phrases and another for paragraphs.

> _Whomever gives Kevin a job will be an even greater genius than I <span style="white-space: nowrap;">- Albert Einstein</span>_

And then there's the blockquote for paragraphs, such as emails or letters.

> **Example of email**
>
> **From:** Albert Einstein &lt;albert@mail.mail&gt;
>
> **To:** Kevin Zanzi &lt;hola@mail.mail&gt;
>
> **Subject:** Job
>
> &nbsp;
>
> Hello Kevin, I've already informed them of my opinion about you. Regards, Albert.

## Lists

Lists are a way to show information in an ordered or unordered way; both can be nested.

### Unordered

They can be used, for example, to show a list of tasks.

- Task 1
- Task 2
  - Subtask 1
  - Subtask 2
    - Subsubtask 1
    - Subsubtask 2

### Ordered

They can be used, for example, to show a list of steps.

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
   1. Substep 1
   2. Substep 2
      1. Subsubstep 1
      2. Subsubstep 2

## Smol boxes

Smol boxes are a way to show information in a small and organized way. They can be used to show a summary and the details of that summary.

### Solitary Smol boxes

An example of use for a solitary smol box would be, for example, to show an error message.

<section class="details-summary" >
  <details>
    <summary>I'm alone &rpar;:</summary>
  </details>
  <article>
    <p>And so you will remain!</p>
  </article>
</section>

---

### Smol boxes in Grouping

On the other hand, smol boxes allow, as an example, to show a list of frequently asked questions.

<article class="details-group">
  <section class="details-summary" >
    <details>
      <summary>What is a smol box?</summary>
    </details>
    <article>
      <p>A smol box is an element that allows you to show information in an ordered and expandable way. It offers a title and content that is displayed when you click on the title.</p>      
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="details-summary" >
    <details>
      <summary>How do you use a smol box?</summary>
    </details>
    <article>
      <p>To use a smol box, you must <kbd>click</kbd> on the title. When you do, the content of the smol box will be displayed.</p>     
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="details-summary" >
    <details>
      <summary>How many smol boxes can be used?</summary>
    </details>
    <article>
      <p>The amount of smol boxes that can be used is unlimited!</p>
    </article>
  </section>
  <section class="details-summary" >
    <details>
      <summary>Why do the smol boxes seem to go in a ladder?</summary>
    </details>
    <article>
      <p>The smol boxes seem to go in a ladder because each time they have more characters. For example, this question has more characters than the previous one.</p>
    </article>
  </section>
</article>

## And lastly,

The end
